# Virginia Parcel Tools
A toolbox for attaching parcel attributes to parcel shapes. This was developed specifically for Virginia parcel data, and is unlikely to work with any other datasets without modification. The toolbox was created in ArcGIS 10.x, but thus far continues to work in ArcGIS Pro.

If you have any problems running a tool, please check the commit (edit) history in this GitHub repository. You may need to download an updated version. If the updated version doesn't work, please direct any questions and bug reports to Kirsten Hazler (kirsten.hazler@dcr.virginia.gov).
